This is my personal Emacs configuration, dating back to the fall of 1997.
It's probably not very interesting to anyone but me, though there are some
potentially useful snippets in here.

To download this repository:

  mkdir w && cd w
  git clone git://github.com/emk/elisp.git
  cd elisp
  git submodule update --init
  cd ../..

To install it on a Unix-like system:

  ln -s w/elisp/dotemacs .emacs

To install it on a Windows system:

  cp -i w/elisp/loader.el .emacs
